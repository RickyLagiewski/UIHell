So its supposed to be like a personality recording website like government or something, 
I just picked this because the government makes really awful websites a lot of the time.

So in Form1 it has address and name, 
both of which if you type in one clears the others, 
also you will notice it will check the incorrect box one you start typing in it,
The radio buttons won't let you fill them in,
The bottom left is just cancer,
Enter button goes to Form2

Form2 has multiple text boxes with your info, mouse over each one and it displays your info,
the blood one makes the background red... cool,
the text box that asks you to press enter in it,
when you press enter it opens form3 it wow coudln't see that coming

Form3, just sit says initializing...,
I thought it was good meme, but if you do look in my code for form 3 you will see much more code,
I was attempting to make it seem like someone was hacking your pc, 
But was unable to change what string it would be typing from :(,
maybe you see an easy solution to where I do not,
It does involve the timer :|
